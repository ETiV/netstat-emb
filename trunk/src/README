DESCRIPTION

	Netstat-EMB is a simple netstat intended primarily for use on embedded Linux systems that may be running
	a crippled version of netstat, or do not include netstat at all.

	Netstat-EMB provides the following features:

		o Support for TCP, UCP and IPv6 sockets
		o Displays the local and remote IP and port numbers for each open socket
		o Corrolates each network socket with its associated process ID and the process file path
		o Displays the command line arguments, if any, passed to the process at run time

	This information is particularly useful when reverse engineering and analyzing live systems.

BUILDING
	
	To build:
	
		$ ./configure CC=armeb-linux-unknown-gcc
		$ make
	
	Be sure to specify the correct cross-compiler when running the configure script. The configure
	script will attempt to auto-detect if the target is big or little endian. In the event that this
	guess is incorrect, it may be specified explicitly:

		$ ./configure ENDIANESS=le
		$ ./configure ENDIANESS=be

USAGE

	By default, Netstat-EMB will display all TCP and UDP IPv4 sockets:

		# ./netstat-emb

	To display IPv6 sockets, use the -6 switch:

		# ./netstat-emb -6
