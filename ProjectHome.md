Netstat-EMB is a simple netstat intended primarily for use on embedded Linux systems that may be running a crippled version of netstat, or which do not include netstat at all.

Netstat-EMB provides the following features:

  * Support for TCP, UCP and IPv6 sockets
  * Displays the local and remote IP and port numbers for each open socket
  * Correlates each network socket with its associated process ID and the process file path
  * Displays command line options passed to the process at run time

This information is particularly useful when reverse engineering and analyzing live systems.
